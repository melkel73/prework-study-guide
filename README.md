# Prework-study-guide

## My first Gitpages Webpage

I created a webpage with javascript and CSS

- This was our first prework module
- It will help with keeping homework notes, although it is not really my preference for notekeeping
- It might work for some, not for others. Use accordingly
- I learned its alot of work to use a webpage just to keep notes LOL
